# ``Controls``

User interface elements including knobs, sliders, XYPads, and more, all built off the same generic controls.

## Overview

Code is hosted on Github: [](https://github.com/AudioKit/Controls/)

### Generic Controls

Two types of controls allow you to drag on a UI element and control either one or two parameters.

* Control - draggable control that can affect one value by planar motion, either horizontally, vertically, or both.
* Two Parameter Control - draggable control that can affect two independent parameters.

### Control Geometries

For both types of controls, there are a wide variety of ways to react to dragging, including
rectilinear and polar coordinate variations. See the API for more details.

### Implementations

These are examples of how to use the generic controls. They are somewhat customizable, so you 
can easier use them directly or use them as a template for creating your own custom controls.

Single-parameter controls:

* ArcKnob - knob controlled by dragging along a circular path
* IndexedSlider - slider that controls an integer parameter and snaps to increments
* PitchModWheel - vertical slider than can be a pitch wheel or mod wheel
* Ribbon - horizontal slider
* SmallKnob - a knob in which you start by tapping in its bound and change the value by either horizontal or vertical motion.

Two-parameter controls:

* Joystick - polar coordinate control
* XYPad - XY control that doesn't snap
    
### Installation

Installation is done with Swift Package Manager. Be sure to tie your code to a version number
and not just a branch, because the API for these controls will change as necessary.
