# Controls

This repository aims to be a repository of somewhat customizable UI controls. 
These include knobs, sliders, XYPads, and more, all built off the same generic controls


## Implementations

* ArcKnob - knob controled by dragging along a circular path
* IndexedSlider - Slider that controls an integer parameter and snaps to increments
* Joystick - XY control that snaps to center
* PitchModWheel - Vertical slider than can be a pitch wheel or mod wheel
* Scrubber - horizontal slider
* SimpleKnob - just a knob
* XYPad - XY control that doesn't snap

## Generic Controls
