# Controls

This repository aims to be a repository of somewhat customizable UI controls. 
These include knobs, sliders, XYPads, and more, all built off the same generic controls


## Implementations

* ArcKnob - knob controled by dragging along a circular path
* IndexedSlider - slider that controls an integer parameter and snaps to increments
* Joystick - XY control that snaps to center
* PitchModWheel - vertical slider than can be a pitch wheel or mod wheel
* Scrubber - horizontal slider
* SmallKnob - a knob in which you start by tapping in its bound and change the value by either horizontal or vertical motion.
* XYPad - XY control that doesn't snap

## Generic Controls

* Control - draggable control that can affect one value by planar motion, either horizontally, vertically, or both.
* Two Parameter Control - draggable control that can affect two indepent paramters.
