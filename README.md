# Controls

User interface elements including knobs, sliders, XYPads, and more, all built off the same generic controls.

## Generic Controls

Two types of controls allow you to drag on a UI element and control either one or two parameters.

* Control - draggable control that can affect one value by planar motion, either horizontally, vertically, or both.
* Two Parameter Control - draggable control that can affect two independent parameters.

## Control Geometries

For both types of controls, there are a wide variety of ways to react to dragging, including
rectilinear and polar coordinate variations. See the API for more details.

## Implementations

These are examples of how to use the generic controls. They are somewhat customizable, so you 
can easier use them directly or use them as a template for creating your own custom controls.

Single-parameter controls:

* ArcKnob - knob controlled by dragging along a circular path
* IndexedSlider - slider that controls an integer parameter and snaps to increments
* PitchModWheel - vertical slider than can be a pitch wheel or mod wheel
* Ribbon - horizontal slider
* SmallKnob - a knob in which you start by tapping in its bound and change the value by either horizontal or vertical motion.

Two-parameter controls:

* Joystick - polar coordinate control
* XYPad - XY control that doesn't snap
    
## Installation

Installation is done with Swift Package Manager. Be sure to tie your code to a version number
and not just a branch, because the API for these controls will change as necessary.  

## Demo

Included with the package is a demo project (pictured above) and a playground to help you 
get up and running quickly.

## Documentation

The docs are hosted on the [AudioKit.io website](https://www.audiokit.io/Controls/)
